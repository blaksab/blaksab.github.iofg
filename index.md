I’m a **CS undergrad student** at IIIT Jabalpur, India interested in machine learning for finance and audio tech. I’m currently interning as a **Data Scientist** at NeenOpal Inc., where I am working as a part of the forecasting team to make predictions for one of the largest tile manufacturing organization in Sri Lanka. 

**When I’m not working at the screen**, I’m either banging my head to heavy metal, chilling out with hiphop/R&B songs, or write about my opinions over various music albums and bands on my second blog [here](https://jithendrabsy.github.io/thoughts/).

Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jithendrabsy), I mostly tweet about data science and machine learning! Feel free to reach out through email: `jithendrabsy [at] gmail [dot] com`.
