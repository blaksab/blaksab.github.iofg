## Filmmaking
I've made a couple of short films and videos in college:
1. [Stoppping by Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uy_3XKqsJZk) - a long short film on conversations. 60k views last I checked!
2. [World War 2 jet in our campus](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/747155185437805/) - a documentary on a very rare artefact inside IIT (BHU) and the fascinating story behind it.
3. [10 ways LC and Facebook is the same thing](https://www.facebook.com/fmc.iitbhu/videos/807030382783618/) - a comedy sketch on how our college hotspot resembles Facebook-ing
4. The Last Date - a cute short flick, that is yet to be compiled and released!

## Data viz
I love playing around with data. Some of my data science and visualization projects have been:
1. Intranet portal of student pics (FaceTrash)
2. Samsung employee entry/exit data (Knox)
3. Internet usage statistics in campus (Squish)
4. Singapore weather data modeling (SUTD Smart City)
5. [US 2020 elections Voter Guide](http://annenberginteractives.com/2020-2021/voting-information-by-state/) with USC Annenberg Media 

## Writing
I write articles, stories, newspapers, blogs, songs and novels. Some of them are:
1. **Sci-fi novel**: DNA Revolution, a story of Venezuela embroilled in a politico-military crisis on the eve of a major breakthrough in genetics.
2. **Short stories book**: Martyrs' Horizon (will upload a soft copy soon!)
3. **Newspaper**: Articles for the college newsletter [Quest](https://issuu.com/thequest_iitbhu) at IIT BHU, and the school newsletter at City Montessori School
4. **Blog**: I've now switched to blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@avijitthawani) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thawani_avijit)

## Sketching
I and my brother [Siddharth Thawani](https://www.instagram.com/sidart.thawani/) loved cartooning as kids (he still does) and sketched several comics.

## Crafts
I've helped my friend Akash in co-founding a startup called [HandyPresents](https://www.facebook.com/handypresents/) which makes persoanlised handmade gifts for special occasions. Think of the 'Handwritten Greeting Cards' company as in the movie 'Her', but with more than just letters! We aggregate tinkering Instagram-ers and local craftsmen, with just the right amount of input from your end to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience for your loved ones.

## Books
I'm a very slow reader and have only managed to go through a limited number of books yet:
- **Society of Mind:** (always reading) A theory of how the mind works, by Marvin Minsky, the ever-so-popular name in Artificial Intelligence. I’ll call it my Bible. Read it after supper daily for at least an year, because you won’t be able to go through three pages in a row without having to note down your thought and contemplate for a while on the mind and your life. [PDF](http://www.acad.bg/ebook/ml/Society%20of%20Mind.pdf)
- **The Story of my Experiments with Truth:** (still reading) is the autobiography of the father of my nation, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, or as the world likes (yet he dislikes) to call him, Mahatma Gandhi. Albert Einstein said of Mahatma Gandhi that: “Generations to come will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.”
- **Thinking Fast and Slow:** (still reading) is the North Star for many-a-scientists working on deep learning and artificial intelligence today. Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel-winning psychologist writes in everyday jargon about the theory that our mind has two systems: System 1 for thinking fast and subconsciously, and System 2 for thinking slow and for rationalization.
- **Why I am a Hindu:** (still reading) by the prominent Congress politician Dr Shashi Tharoor is an amazing account of Hinduism and all its mysteries. As a westernized Indian who’s only recently begun taking interest (and pride) in our Indic history and culture, I’m loving the book!
- **Wealth of Nations:** (still reading) is a complicated volume from 1776, written by arguably the world’s first economist, Adam Smith. The first chapter (Division of Labour) mesmerized me to the point of purchasing it!
- **Steve Jobs** by Walter Isaacson is an expanded version (totally worth the time) of the several documentaries I’ve already watched on one of the most visionary leaders and innovators of the millennium.
- **1984:** The classic Communist dystopia painted by George Orwell totally lived up to the hype around it. On topics such as freedom, language, sexuality, and war, it is not only full of thoughtful contemplations but also witty one-liners, that I’ve tried compiling into a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/avijit_thawani/orwell/)!
- **Outliers:** an amazing essay by Malcolm Gladwell to show how success is rarely explained by examining the individual, but is rather a cumulative of the culture, the timing, and more often than not, sheer luck.
- **Man’s Search for Meaning:** is Victor Frankl’s experiences as a Holocaust survivor, along with his treatise on logotherapy. It very casually walks us through the typical day at a concentration camp while discussing not only the tortures of the guards (and the other inmates) but also the dehumanizing effects of it all.
- **Mein Kampf:** The first volume written by Adolf Hitler when in prison for the unsuccessful attempt (called Beer Hall Putsch) to seize authority by force. I like to think of this book as his Statement of Purpose for applying to the post of Führer, containing not just his principles and the rationale behind them, but also a biographical account of all he’s been through as part of the bourgeois in Vienna before learning to lead them.
- **Zero to One:** A startup management mantra collection plus inspirational calls-to-action by Peter Thiel, the billionaire founder of PayPal, the first investor and still a Board member at Facebook, and currently chairman at Palantir (world’s 2nd largest startup after Uber). He refers to startups that incrementally push the frontiers of an industry as going from 1 to 2 or 2 to 10. But how do you leap from 0 to 1?
- **How to Win Friends and Influence People:** Dale Carnegie’s 1933 guide was suggested to me by [Vish Iyer](https://sg.linkedin.com/in/viswanathan-iyer-90a0781), for which I’ll always thank him :)
- **The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck:** Mark Manson’s clickbait-y title is almost a contradiction to Dale Carnegie’s book above, and for that reason, I loved reading them both together, and frequently discussing the differences with Drishti.
- **The Alchemist:** My first read after a long time. This parable by Paul Coelho is a must-read for all, and a must-write-their-interpretation too. It's the closest thing to a religious text in the modern world. Having appreciated the intricacies of story development in this 150-page forced me to consider the efforts required to come up with humongous mythological parables like Ramayana and Mahabharata.
- **Sentic Computing:** A curation of academic progress in the fields of Sentiment Analysis, emotional models and Sentic Computing. Written by Erik Cambria, Assistant Professor at NTU, Singapore. [PDF](http://sentic.net/sentic-computing.pdf)
- **The Pleasure of Finding Things Out:** A list of articles, interviews, lectures and talks by Richard Feynman, the phenomenal physicist and teacher.
- **Scion of Ikshvaku:** The first part of a trilogy by Amish Tripathi retelling the Ramayana with minimal magic and maximal analysis. The concepts of Ram Rajya, brewing up within Lord Rama as a child, and the masculine and feminine societies, feel quite relatable and worth pondering upon even (or especially) today.
- **Mortal Engines:** Philip Reeve’s steampunk classic (that’s my favorite genre) about a post-apocalyptic world where cities (like London) are giant machines moving about chasing and attacking other cities.
- **Deception Point:** One of Dan Brown’s, telling a story of an elaborate (fictional) conspiracy and the rush to uncover it.
- **Digital Fortress:** Another one by Dan Brown. An amusing tale of espionage, adventure and a race against time to prevent a technological disaster.
- **Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul:** The classic collection of shorts based on (mostly) real stories with a certain theme. Thoroughly insightful and inspirational.
- **Oliver Twist:** A Charles Dickens story I read as a child. The powerful use of English was a little too much for me in second grade.
- **Sapiens:** (to read) Yuval Noah Harari
- **The Lucknow Omnibus:** (to read) Jones Rosie Llwellyn
- **5 am club:** (to read) Robin Sharma
- **21 Lessons for the 21st Century:** (to read) YNH
- **The New World Disorder and the Indian Imperative:** (to read) Shashi Tharoor
- **Einstein:** (to read) Walter Isaacson
- **How Google Works:** (to read) Eric Schmidt
- **Thank you for being late:** (to read) Thomas Friedman
- **Propaganda:** (to read) Edward Bernays, suggested by [Dr Puneet Bindlish](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/hss/people/puneethss)
- **Atomic Habits:** (to read) James Clear
- **Hit Refresh:** (to read) Satya Nadella
- **Factfulness:** (to read) Hans Rosling
- **The Stuff of Thought:** (to read) Steven Pinker (suggested by [Prof Irving Biederman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Biederman))
- **The Emotion Machine:** (to read) Marvin Minsky (inspired the movie [Inside Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/))

## Misc
As a freshman in college, I tried my hands on all sorts of extra curricular activities:
1. **Street Play**: on blood donation at a slum near campus
2. **Dance**: ranging from Bhangra to David Guetta and Govinda dance, we did it all!
3. **Robotics**: stood 1st at a robot making and handling event - [the best day in my life](https://www.facebook.com/avijit.thawani/posts/796281477100748). If I scripted the day, I couldn't have made it any better (unless you allow me to script Emma Watson into the story) 
4. **Skit**: on media corruption. I played Rahul Gandhi!
5. **Contraption**: at a contest called Goldberg's Alley. For those who don't know what a contraption is, think of the set of traps that Tom often set up for Jerry to step into. One action leads to another and finally resulting in a reaction, which is usually Tom-caught-up-in-his-own-trap.
6. **Rap** songs in Hindi and English, inspired from [Kartavyo, the Sanskrit-English rap song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8oL_FKr1zw) by Arihant and Apoorv
7. **Stand-up Comedy**: at the Lit Club and The Tripling Bistro
